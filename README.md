<h2>FLOWStrap</h2>

All you have to do is, within the row and col statement with the broad span set, they must come down into total to 12 columns. as an example, a 3-column layout to build, you need the following code:

<pre>
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col span-4"&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="col span-4"&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="col span-4"&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
